Language skills are productive in a human capital sense and can also be used to signal unobservable traits to employers. Due to the informational asymmetry between workers and employees, the equilibrium rate of bilingualism in the economy may exceed the socially efficient level. On the other hand, the spillovers associated with second language acquisition may imply there is not enough bilingualism relative to the social optimum. We consider the circumstances under which either the signalling or the network welfare effects dominate in equilibrium. Depending on the parameter values of the model, policies of either encouraging or discouraging the investment in language skills may be welfare enhancing. "

In this study, we use individual-level data from the 2005 India Human Development Survey to quantify the effects of English-language skills on wages. After controlling for age, social group, schooling, geography, and proxies for ability, we find that hourly wages are on average 34% higher for men who speak fluent English and 13% higher for men who speak a little English relative to men who do not speak English. The return to fluent English is as large as the return to completing secondary school and half as large as the return to completing a bachelor’s degree. In addition, we find that more experienced and more educated workers receive higher returns to English. The complementarity between English skills and education appears to have strengthened over time—only the more educated among young workers receive a premium for English-speaking ability, whereas older workers across all education groups do.},

Find large effects, fluent English speakers earn 4x more than those who do not speak. When controlling for age, education, ability, geography, it reduces to 40% for fluent speakers and 14% for non-fluent ones. These returns compare to high school/college returns.

Especially in Europe, with its 24 official languages and its countless regional and minority languages, foreign language skills are a key asset in the labor market. Earlier research shows that over half of the EU27 population is able to speak at least one foreign language, but there is substantial national variation. This study is devoted to a group of countries known as the Visegrad Four, which comprises the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Although the supply of foreign language skills in these countries appears to be well-documented, less is known about the demand side. In this study, we therefore examine the demand for foreign language skills on the Visegrad labour markets, using information extracted from online job portals. We find that English is the most requested foreign language in the region, and the demand for English language skills appears to go up as occupations become increasingly complex. Despite the cultural, historical and economic ties with their German-speaking neighbors, German is the second-most-in-demand foreign language in the region. Interestingly, in this case there is no clear link with the complexity of an occupation. Other languages, such as French, Spanish and Russian, are hardly requested. These findings have important policy implications with regards to the education and training offered in schools, universities and job centers.},

Our findings suggest large returns among Africans to reading and writing English very well, and particularly among those who have a tertiary education.

Immigrants tend to take language differences across countries into account when deciding whether to migrate and in the choice of the destination. The propensity to migrate to a particular destination, other variables being the same, is greater the smaller the “linguistic distance” between the migrant's language skills and the dominant language in the destination. The determinants of destination language proficiency are shown to be consistent with a model based on the Exposure to the destination language in the origin and the destination, Efficiency in acquiring destination language proficiency, including education, age at migration and linguistic distance, among other variables, and Economic incentives, including the effects of higher earnings and a longer expected duration of residence. This model is shown to be robust for the several immigrant receiving countries studied. Earnings among immigrants are shown to be greater among those more proficient in the destination language, other variables being the same. The earnings payoff tends to be high, yet this underestimates the total returns as it does not include the social, cultural, and political benefits of destination proficiency or the complementarity of destination language skills and investments in other forms of human capital. The chapter closes with a discussion of some policy issues. },

In the presence of considerable non-classical measurement error in self-reported language proficiency, our results provide lower and upper bounds for the true effect of English deficiency on health of one half and a full standard deviation in the health score respectively. The empirical analysis is framed in terms of a Grossman model which indicates a twofold role of language skills in health production: language deficiency directly affects the efficiency of health production and indirectly affects access to health inputs. We provide some suggestive evidence on the relative importance of these distinct roles.},

	the relationship between the ability to speak the Welsh language
	and unemployment in Wales. Using the Sample of Anonymised Records

	experience lower unemployment rates than those only able to speak
	English. The paper then suggests possible reasons for this observation.
	These include assimilation, positive discrimination and differences
	in characteristics between Welsh and non-Welsh speakers. It is found
	that characteristic differences alone are not responsible for the

The study differs from other studies that deal with the same issue in three respects. First, instead of using a dummy for each language, they use the ratio of the population not proficient in a given country's national language and compare the results with the more traditional approach using dummies. Second, they correct for time-independent measurement errors in self-reporting and find that the resulting IV estimates are much larger than those obtained by OLS. They also suggest that there is little room for time-persistent errors and heterogeneity and that therefore their estimates should suffer ostensibly little from unobserved ability biases. Finally, they estimate IV quantile regressions to illustrate how returns to languages vary at different points of the distribution of earnings.},

	Minorities have incentives to become assimilated and to learn the
	majority language so that they have a larger pool of potential trading
	partners. The value of assimilation is larger to someone from a small
	minority than to one from a large minority group. When a society
	has a very large majority of individuals from one culture, individuals
	from minority groups will be assimilated more quickly. Assimilation
	is less likely when an immigrant's native culture and language is
	broadly represented in his new country. Also, when governments protect
	minority interests directly, incentives to be assimilated into the
	majority culture are reduced. Both factors may explain the recent
	rise in multiculturalism. Individuals do not properly internalize
	the social value of assimilation and ignore the benefits others receive
	when they learn the majority language and become assimilated. In
	a pluralistic society, a government policy that encourages diverse
	cultural immigration over concentrated immigration is likely to increase
	the welfare of the population. In the absence of strong offsetting
	effects, policies which encourage multi- culturalism reduce the amount
	of trade and have adverse welfare consequences. Conversely, policies
	that subsidize assimilation and the acquisition of majority language
	skills can be socially beneficial. The theory is tested and confirmed
	by examining U.S. Census data, which reveals that the likelihood
	that an immigrant will learn English is inversely related to the
	proportion of the local population that speaks his or her native

Find that all languages are related to substantial wage premium, even when controlling for industry effects, except that Arabic gives negative effect.  Looking at skill levels separately, advanced level is typically associated with much more income, except basic Russian has the highest figure of all.

English effect is stable over subgroups, quantile regression shows higher returns at the upper end, but that goes away if introducing occupation controls.},

This article aims to estimate the effect that using an additional language at work has on earnings for a sample of workers in the European Community Household Panel survey. OLS and fixed-effects specifications of log-earnings regressions are estimated by country with controls for standard human capital, job, and personal characteristics. Findings ? The results indicate that the use of a second language in the workplace raises earnings by 3 to 5 percent in several Western European nations, with even greater returns found in some. The estimated returns are found to be correlated with the extent of tourism in the country, but not other measures of trade. Originality/value ? This is the first paper to estimate returns to usage of an additional language in the workplace across the European Union, and contributes to our knowledge of the benefits of multi-lingualism.},
