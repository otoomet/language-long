Accordingly, the Canadian measure of the Francophone gap better reflects the changing welfare of Francophones than the Quebec measure. Over half of the reduction in the Canadian Francophone wage gap is explained by rising Francophone education levels. In Quebec, the declining number and relative wages of Anglophone workers is best explained by a falling demand for English-speaking labour.},

Many of these migrants are members of Russian-speaking minorities leaving a context of restrictive citizenship and language laws and varying degrees of ethnic tension. This article draws on interviews collected in Ireland to examine the role played by the contexts of exit in decisions to migrate among Russian-speaking minorities from the Baltics. The results suggest that Russian speakers from Estonia migrate because of their experiences as minorities, while those from Latvia and Lithuania migrate to escape low wages and irregular employment. This is so despite equally restrictive language and citizenship laws in Estonia and Latvia. I argue that the effect of state policy as a push factor for minority emigration is mediated by other contextual aspects, such as levels of contact, timbre of ethnic relations, and the degree of intersection between economic stratification and ethnicity. },

Language skills are productive in a human capital sense and can also be used to signal unobservable traits to employers. Due to the informational asymmetry between workers and employees, the equilibrium rate of bilingualism in the economy may exceed the socially efficient level. On the other hand, the spillovers associated with second language acquisition may imply there is not enough bilingualism relative to the social optimum. We consider the circumstances under which either the signalling or the network welfare effects dominate in equilibrium. Depending on the parameter values of the model, policies of either encouraging or discouraging the investment in language skills may be welfare enhancing. },

  abstract  = {Abstract India’s colonial legacy and linguistic diversity give English an important role in its economy, and this role has expanded due to globalization in recent decades. In this study, we use individual-level data from the 2005 India Human Development Survey to quantify the effects of English-language skills on wages. After controlling for age, social group, schooling, geography, and proxies for ability, we find that hourly wages are on average 34% higher for men who speak fluent English and 13% higher for men who speak a little English relative to men who do not speak English. The return to fluent English is as large as the return to completing secondary school and half as large as the return to completing a bachelor’s degree. In addition, we find that more experienced and more educated workers receive higher returns to English. The complementarity between English skills and education appears to have strengthened over time—only the more educated among young workers receive a premium for English-speaking ability, whereas older workers across all education groups do.},
  comment   = {Use India 2005 Human Development Survey to estimate association b/w English and wage. The total sample is 125,000, out of which 38% participate in wage employment. 

Do not use instruments but proxy ability by repeating class and parental education. This has little effect on English results though.

Find large effects, fluent English speakers earn 4x more than those who do not speak. When controlling for age, education, ability, geography, it reduces to 40% for fluent speakers and 14% for non-fluent ones. These returns compare to high school/college returns. 
Language-skill complementarity: older and more educated workers have larger returns, the complementarity seems to be growing.

Higher castes have higher returns.

Lower returns where larger supply of skills.

Results for women quite similar to men.

  abstract    = {In a globalized world, knowledge of foreign languages is an important skill. Especially in Europe, with its 24 official languages and its countless regional and minority languages, foreign language skills are a key asset in the labor market. Earlier research shows that over half of the EU27 population is able to speak at least one foreign language, but there is substantial national variation. This study is devoted to a group of countries known as the Visegrad Four, which comprises the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Although the supply of foreign language skills in these countries appears to be well-documented, less is known about the demand side. In this study, we therefore examine the demand for foreign language skills on the Visegrad labour markets, using information extracted from online job portals. We find that English is the most requested foreign language in the region, and the demand for English language skills appears to go up as occupations become increasingly complex. Despite the cultural, historical and economic ties with their German-speaking neighbors, German is the second-most-in-demand foreign language in the region. Interestingly, in this case there is no clear link with the complexity of an occupation. Other languages, such as French, Spanish and Russian, are hardly requested. These findings have important policy implications with regards to the education and training offered in schools, universities and job centers.},
  comment     = {Use internet job portals to assess occupational language requirements across the occupations in CEE. 

* English is more important than any other foreign language.
* English requirements strongly correlates with occupation-specific salary
* German is essentially uncorrelated with salary.

Conclude that English is required on complex jobs, German not.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a simple theory of wage differentials among language groups. In multilingual societies, if labor demand for speakers of one language exceeds the supply of native speakers, bilingual workers will generally come from other language groups. There will be a wage premium for speaking the "excess demand" language but no additional premium for being bilingual. This pattern is generally consistent with evidence from the 1971 Canadian Census. In Quebec there were substantial economic rewards to learning French or English for men who spoke neither, and substantial rewards to speaking English for native French speakers. Even after learning English, however, and holding other factors constant, native French-speaking men earned lower wages than monolingual English men. There was no significant wage premium for native English speakers who learned French. Outside Quebec, monolingual English men earned significantly higher wages than men whose native language was neither French nor English, other factors constant, but there were no significant differences in wage rates between them and bilingual English or monolingual or bilingual French workers.},

In our study we analyse the returns to language skills in a developing country context where the dominant language of business, government and education is that of the former colony, although not more than one percent of the African majority population group speaks English as their home language. Our findings suggest large returns among Africans to reading and writing English very well, and particularly among those who have a tertiary education.

Working in an occupation that requires greater English language skills, whether measured by the level of these skills or the importance of English for performing the job, has a large effect on earnings among the native born, and an even larger effect among the foreign born. This effect is reduced by 50 percent, but is still large, when worker characteristics, including their own English language skills, are held constant. Earnings increase with the respondent’s own proficiency in English, with the English proficiency required for the occupation, and when those with high levels of proficiency work in jobs requiring English language skills (interaction effect). There is, therefore, a strong economic incentive for the matching of worker’s English skills and the occupation’s requirements, and this matching does tend to occur in the labor market.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This chapter reports on the “economics of language” for immigrants—that is, the influence of language on the choice of destination among international migrants, the determinants among immigrants of destination language proficiency, and the labor market consequences of that proficiency, as expressed in their earnings. Immigrants tend to take language differences across countries into account when deciding whether to migrate and in the choice of the destination. The propensity to migrate to a particular destination, other variables being the same, is greater the smaller the “linguistic distance” between the migrant's language skills and the dominant language in the destination. The determinants of destination language proficiency are shown to be consistent with a model based on the Exposure to the destination language in the origin and the destination, Efficiency in acquiring destination language proficiency, including education, age at migration and linguistic distance, among other variables, and Economic incentives, including the effects of higher earnings and a longer expected duration of residence. This model is shown to be robust for the several immigrant receiving countries studied. Earnings among immigrants are shown to be greater among those more proficient in the destination language, other variables being the same. The earnings payoff tends to be high, yet this underestimates the total returns as it does not include the social, cultural, and political benefits of destination proficiency or the complementarity of destination language skills and investments in other forms of human capital. The chapter closes with a discussion of some policy issues. },

These scores are linked to microdata on employed adult (aged 25 to 64) males, both native born and foreign born, as reported in the 2000 Census, one percent sample. Working in an occupation that requires greater English language skills, whether measured by the level of these skills or the importance of English for performing the job, has a large effect on earnings among the native born, and an even larger effect among the foreign born. This effect is reduced by 50 percent, but is still large, when worker characteristics, including their own English language skills, are held constant. Earnings increase with the respondent’s own proficiency in English, with the English proficiency required for the occupation, and when those with high levels of proficiency work in jobs requiring English language skills (interaction effect). There is, therefore, a strong economic incentive for the matching of worker’s English skills and the occupation’s requirements, and this matching does tend to occur in the labor market.},

Our identification strategy relies on a quasi-experiment comparing immigrants arriving at different ages and from different linguistic origins by utilising a measure of differences along a continuous range of linguistic distances. Our main results indicate a large negative effect of English deficiency on physical health that is robust to a range of different specifications. In the presence of considerable non-classical measurement error in self-reported language proficiency, our results provide lower and upper bounds for the true effect of English deficiency on health of one half and a full standard deviation in the health score respectively. The empirical analysis is framed in terms of a Grossman model which indicates a twofold role of language skills in health production: language deficiency directly affects the efficiency of health production and indirectly affects access to health inputs. We provide some suggestive evidence on the relative importance of these distinct roles.},

Using the Sample of Anonymised Records from the 1991 Census of the Population , it is found that Welsh speakers experience lower unemployment rates than those only able to speak English. The paper then suggests possible reasons for this observation. These include assimilation, positive discrimination and differences in characteristics between Welsh and non-Welsh speakers. It is found that characteristic differences alone are not responsible for the entire unemployment differential. This is particularly the case for West Wales. DRINKWATER S. J. et O'LEARY N. C.

A partir d'un echantillon des registres qui gardent l'anonymat et qui proviennent du recensement de la population de 1991, il s'avere que les taux de chomage de ceux qui parlent la langue galloise sont inferieurs aux taux relatifs a ceux qui ne parlent que la langue anglaise. Il s'ensuit des explications eventuelles de ce constat, dont l'assimilation, la discrimination positive et les differentes caracteristiques de ceux qui parlent la langue galloise par rapport a ceux qui ne la parlent pas.

The authors' study, which uses the European Community Household Panel Survey for the period 1994-2001, infers returns to non-native languages by native workers in nine countries of the European Union. The study differs from other studies that deal with the same issue in three respects. First, instead of using a dummy for each language, they use the ratio of the population not proficient in a given country's national language and compare the results with the more traditional approach using dummies. Second, they correct for time-independent measurement errors in self-reporting and find that the resulting IV estimates are much larger than those obtained by OLS. They also suggest that there is little room for time-persistent errors and heterogeneity and that therefore their estimates should suffer ostensibly little from unobserved ability biases. Finally, they estimate IV quantile regressions to illustrate how returns to languages vary at different points of the distribution of earnings.},

  Abstract                 = {This study examines the returns to foreign and local language skills of immigrants in the Spanish labor market. Different sources of endogeneity are addressed by deriving a set of novel instruments for language proficiency through a measure of linguistic dissimilarity. Using cross-sectional data from the 2007 National Immigrant Survey of Spain (NISS), returns to language skills are estimated separately for Spanish, English, German and French proficiency. Foreign language proficiency produces high returns, which appear to be mediated through the channel of occupational choice. The results are discussed against the background of a severe foreign language skills shortage in the Spanish economy. Immigrants may deal as a supplier of foreign language proficiency in the short run. In contrast to most studies, I find no compelling evidence of a wage premium for local language proficiency. -- -- Diese Studie dient der Identifizierung von kausalen Effekten von Sprachkenntnissen in Fremdsprachen und der Gastlandssprache von Immigranten in Spanien. Um Endogenit\"{a}tsprobleme und Me\ss{}fehlerproblematiken zu beheben, setzt die Analyse auf einen Instrumentvariablensch\"{a}tzer. Die verwendeten Instrumente basieren auf Information \"{u}ber die linguistische Distanz, also die Unterschiedlichkeit zwischen Muttersprache und erlernter Sprache. Als Datenbasis dient der National Immigrant Survey of Spain aus dem Jahr 2007. Die Ergebnisse weisen auf deutliche Lohnvorteile durch deutsche, englische und franz\"{o}sische Sprachkenntnisse hin. Entgegen fr\"{u}herer Studien findet sich keine deutliche Evidenz f\"{u}r Lohnvorteile durch Spanischkenntnisse. Die Ergebnisse werden vor dem Hintergrund eines deutlichen Engpasses in Fremdsprachenkenntnissen der einheimischen Bev\"{o}lkerung diskutiert.},

  Abstract                 = {Common culture and common language facilitate trade between people. Minorities have incentives to become assimilated and to learn the majority language so that they have a larger pool of potential trading partners. The value of assimilation is larger to someone from a small minority than to one from a large minority group. When a society has a very large majority of individuals from one culture, individuals from minority groups will be assimilated more quickly. Assimilation is less likely when an immigrant's native culture and language is broadly represented in his new country. Also, when governments protect minority interests directly, incentives to be assimilated into the majority culture are reduced. Both factors may explain the recent rise in multiculturalism. Individuals do not properly internalize the social value of assimilation and ignore the benefits others receive when they learn the majority language and become assimilated. In a pluralistic society, a government policy that encourages diverse cultural immigration over concentrated immigration is likely to increase the welfare of the population. In the absence of strong offsetting effects, policies which encourage multi- culturalism reduce the amount of trade and have adverse welfare consequences. Conversely, policies that subsidize assimilation and the acquisition of majority language skills can be socially beneficial. The theory is tested and confirmed by examining U.S. Census data, which reveals that the likelihood that an immigrant will learn English is inversely related to the proportion of the local population that speaks his or her native language.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

Data from Estonian Labour Force Surveys (2002–2011) are used to compare the duration of unemployment before finding the first job and the status of the first job for post-first generation Russian-speaking minorities and young Estonians of the ethnic majority. The results show that the effects of ethnicity and language proficiency depend on region. Although high proficiency in the Estonian language increases labour market success for ethnic minority youth, a Russian-language environment seems to reduce the negative effect of poor skills in the Estonian language to some extent. Spatial segregation also affects labour market entry for Estonians because knowledge of the Russian language has some value for finding a job in areas with a high concentration of Russian-speaking ethnic minorities. Only in Tallinn, where the size of ethnic communities is almost equal, do the Russian-speaking minorities experience an ethnic disadvantage.},

Cross section statistics on labour market status and outflows from unemployment are analysed. No significant between-group differences in labour force participation are found. Differences in unemployment cannot either be explained by human capital factors or local labour market conditions. Being a Swedish-speaker decreases the odds of being unemployed by 30%, while it increases the transition rate from unemployment by 15%. Language proficiency and social integration are the likely reasons behind these differences. },

Population assumptions are stated separately from sampling assumptions, leading to simple statements as well as to important insights. The unified approach to linear and nonlinear models and to cross section and panel data enables straightforward coverage of more advanced methods.

We study the case of the Chinese enclave in New York City, using three distinct operational definitions of the enclave--as a place of residence, place of work, and industrial sector. Regardless of the definition employed, there is considerable evidence of positive returns for earnings for male enclave workers from education, labor market experience, and English-language ability. By contrast, none of these human capital variables is positively related to income of female enclave workers. Implications of these results for comparative research are suggested.},
