{\centering \textbf{Language Skills in an Ethnically Segmented Labour market: Estonia 1989 -- 2012}}
\begin{abstract}
	
	\noindent	\textbf{Purpose --} The purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between language skills and labour market
outcomes in Estonia, a linguistically divided country where Estonian
is the sole official language.\\
\textbf{Design/methodology/approach --} The authors use the Estonian Labour Force Survey from 1989 to 2012 to study the impact of language skills on unemployment (probability) and wages.\\
\textbf{Findings --} For men, fluency in
Estonian is related to approximately 5 percentage points lower unemployment, but to virtually no income
premium. English skills are associated with a
substantial income premium, but are virtually unrelated to
unemployment. Russian skills are related to higher wages for Estonians,
but the premium is falling over time and Russian is not associated with lower unemployment.	\\
\textbf{Research limitations/implications -- } No casual claims are possible unless a suitable instruments for language skills can be found. Individual characteristics are able to explain a
large part of English returns, so that part of the remaining effect
may also be related to an ability bias. 
The usage of self-reported language skills may introduce measurement errors, which may	decrease in the future, as language test data becomes available.\\	
\textbf{Practical implications --} These results can be explained by simultaneous ethnic and gender
segregation where the high-skilled male labour market is more segregated
than the female labour market, and females are more often working in
communication-intensive jobs.\\
\textbf{Originality/value --} This paper provides a comprehensive overview about the effects of language skills on labour market outcomes for a linguistically divided, low immigration population. In contrast, the existing literature deals mostly with the effects of language skills on the labour market outcomes of immigrants. \\

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Numerous studies document that language skills are related to better
labour market outcomes.
Speaking different languages may make workers genuinely more
productive, either by facilitating communication at the workplace
or by making it possible to perform
tasks that require language knowledge.
Enhanced productivity, in turn, should be reflected both in better wage
and in improved employment prospects.


The bulk of the existing literature analyses the effect of knowledge
of the local majority language for immigrants.  It is well known that
language skills are associated with a substantial an income premium
between 5 and 35 percent
\citep{Chiswick1995,bleakley+chin2004,shields+price2002,leslie+lindley2001,chiswick+miller2002,Chiswick2003,Chiswick2010,Chiswick2015, Dustmann2003}.  For
instance, \citet{chiswick2008} argues that ``proficient'' speakers
typically earn about 15\% more than ``not proficient'' speakers.
The effect works largely through improving educational attainment
\citep{bleakley+chin2004,rooth+saarela2007native}.  Language skills are
also complementary to other types of human capital
\citep{chiswick+miller2007}.
Immigrants who are fluent in the local language also suffer
substantially less from unemployment \citep{shields+price2002, Dustmann2003}.



However, in case of less-than-perfect ethnic integration, the ``local''
language in ethnic enclaves may be the minority language instead, in
this way limiting the usefulness of the majority language skills
\citep{chiswick+miller2002,hwang+2010} in particular in context of ethnic segregation and
limited access to upper-end jobs \citep{Toomet2011}.  However, the
existing evidence suggests that the majority language is
an important production factor in the ethnic enclaves as well
\citep{zhou+logan1989, clark+drinkwater2000}.


There is also an increasing body of literature focusing on relationship
between other languages than the local main business language and
income.  These studies generally find
that English is a significant predictor of better income
\citep{Lang2009, Casale2011, Toomet2011, Williams2011, azam+2013EDandCC, isphording2013, beblavy+2016CEPS}.


The role of other languages is
less clear.  It is especially unclear what is the role of
different languages in a multi-lingual economy.  For instance,
\cite{Drinkwater1997} finds
a positive effect for Welsh speaking workers in
Wales but \citet{FrancoisGrin1998}, in contrast,
shows that Italian language skills in Swiss non-Italian speaking
regions are associated with lower wage.  It remains unclear if
this is a true effect or just an omitted variable bias.
It is estimated by \cite{Armstrong2015} that there is a statistically significant premium paid to bilingual people both inside and outside Quebec who speak French as their mother tongue People speaking English as their mother tongue also earn a premium, but it is much smaller outside of Quebec. In some cases it is even statistically not significant.


Few previous studies have provided a comprehensive analysis of a labour
market from the viewpoint of language skills.
\citet{Chiswick1995, chiswick+miller2002, chiswick+miller2007, Bellante1998, Chiswick2010} analyse the effects of dominant language fluency for earnings among immigrants in the United States and
\citet{Chiswick1995}  also analyse it for Canada, Australia and Israel.
\citet{Dustmann2003, shields+price2002} explore of immigrant assimilation into the labour market of the United Kingdom.


\citet{leslie+lindley2001} analyse both employment and income but
focus on a single year and English language only.
\citet{YaoandOurs2015} only analyse the role of Dutch language
on labour market performance in Netherlands.  In case of Estonia,
\citet{Toomet2011} shows that the majority language gives little wage
premium for minority men.  However, he analyses neither women, nor
unemployment.  \citet{Lindemann2013} shows that Estonian fluency
is associated with faster job finding rate while while it does not
explain the lower occupational prestige of Russian speakers.  However,
she only includes recent school graduates in her study.\\


\noindent In this paper, we analyse the relationship between both
majority and minority language skills, and English for both
wage and unemployment.  We analyse Estonia, a linguistically divided
country where a large Russian-speaking community forms almost 30\% of
the population.  We provide long--term trends from the last years
of the planned economy in 1989 till the post-recession time in 2012.


We find that in case of, Estonian language is associated with very
small albeit slowly increasing wage premium over
the years, but only for women.
Russian skills, on the other hand, are clearly related to
higher wage but the relationship is slowly fading. English fluency was
associated with a very large wage premium during the first decade
after the introduction of the market economy, it's importance later
declined, but was still large in 2012.  For
women, the wage premium of each of these languages is roughly equal.
In contrast, the sole language that plays a role in determining
unemployment is Estonian, it's fluency is associated with
approximately 5 percentage points lower unemployment rate.
These results suggest that Estonian labour market is
segmented both along gender and the ethnic boundaries, men
more likely occupied in less communication-intense jobs.
This view is
supported by data from a specifically designed ethnic integration
dataset.



The paper continues as follows: The next section provides a brief
background of Estonian society and labour market. In the following
section we discuss the data and provide some descriptive
statistics. In \cref{sec:method} we describe the econometric
approach, sections \ref{sec:results} and \ref{sec:extensions} present
the results for unemployment probability and wages.

\section{Background: Ethnic Groups and Languages in Estonia}
\label{sec:hist_background}

This section briefly reviews Estonian institutional background,
focusing on the role of ethnic groups and languages.
See \citet{Leping2008} and
\citet{lindemann+saar2011Russian2ndGeneration} for more information.

Before the Second World War, Estonia was ethnically rather
homogeneous, populated almost exclusively by ethnic Estonians. After the War,
the Russian-speaking population grew rapidly through migration and
reached 40\% by 1989.
Such an influx of mainly
Russian-speaking population
led to two \emph{de facto} official languages
by 1970s.
The society was largely divided across language, and the division was
also reflected at workplace \citep{leppik+vihalemm2015JofBaltStud}.


Certain sectors in the economy, such as the army, railways and the
merchant fleet
were dominated by
Russian-speaking workers while more local industries,
such as agriculture and
local public administration,
were dominated by ethnic Estonians.
Both communities followed the media in their own respective language, the
universities taught many subjects in Russian and Estonian,
and service sector was largely bilingual.  However, the bilingualism
was mainly one-sided as the bulk of Estonians spoke Russian, but not
the other way around.  A particular institution in parts of the Soviet
Union was segregated school system, where Russian schools existed along the
schools teaching in the local language.  Hence a common education
system, one of the central integration mechanisms in the developed world,
was (and still largely is) missing in Estonia.
The widening use of Russian also
caused increasing concerns about the future of the Estonian
language, in turn leading to  unwillingness to use Russian by
the ethnic Estonians.  This further strengthened the language-based segregation.

When the central Soviet authority weakened during the late 1980, the
Estonian-speaking community was quick to organize and establish a
nation-state in 1991 where
Estonian was granted status as the sole official language.  The
above-mentioned ``one-sided bilingualism'' slowly started turning
around.  The universities quickly moved to Estonian-only curriculum,
Estonian language become a large-scale compulsory subject in Russian
schools while teaching Russian in Estonian-language schools declined.
Since 2007, all Russian high-schools have to teach part of the
curriculum in Estonian \citep{lindemann+saar2011Russian2ndGeneration}.

According to the report of the Ministry of Education and Research the number
of students, whose mother tongue is not Estonian in basic schools who study in the Estonian language increased from 17,5\% in 2005 to 25,8\% in 2015 due to the growing popularity of immersion
classes (enrolment of classes rose from 7,8\% in 2005 to 17,5\% in 2015).
At the same time the number of students whose mother tongue is not Estonian studying in Estonian basic schools slowly dropped respectively from 9,5\% to  8,3\% \citep{HTM2015}.


The younger generation of ethnic Estonians is
increasingly less fluent in Russian while the opposite is true for ethnic Russians. As
a bi-product of the rapid integration to the West, the importance of English language rose
substantially.

As a result of the economic and political reforms, substantial
disparities in income and education opportunities
emerged
in the early 1990s \citep{Leping2008,
	lindemann+saar2011Russian2ndGeneration}.  The inter-ethnic contacts
are largely limited to superficial encounters at work and in public
space, the close private ties remain limited
\citep{korts2009JofBaltStud}.  Both ethnic groups have only few  are
largely living on their own with limited contacts. The
separate worlds are also reflected in media which may present quite
different and occasionally antagonistic viewpoints depending on the
language \citep{Korts2002}.  Around 25\% of Estonians show little
tolerance for Russian-speaking population (the corresponding figure
for Russians is substantially smaller).  A major issue for this group
is Russians' ability and willingness to communicate in Estonian.


\section{Data}
\label{subsec:ss_var}

\subsection{Variables and Sample Selection}
\label{sec:variables}

Our main analysis relies on the Estonian Labour Force Survey (ELFS),
first conducted in 1995. Until 1999 the survey was an annual
cross-section and later as a quarterly rotating panel.  The number of distinct
individuals is around 4000 annually. However, due to the rotating
structure, we have about 16,000 annual observations.
The reader should keep in mind that while the pre-2000 waves include retrospective income, they do not include retrospective language skills. In this way, the results before
1995 are partly based on extrapolation, assuming individual language
skills did not vary before that date.  In the main analysis, we only
analyse the 2000--2012 time period but we also provide a long-term
picture that includes the
earlier waves from 1989--1999.
We limit ourselves to men and women in the main working age, between 25 and
55 years old.  Further, we only analyse
individuals who are either working or actively looking for a job.

The dataset allows us to control for standard personal
characteristics and human capital variables, such as age, education
and family status.  The central variables in this study are the same
as in \citep{Leping2008}:

In all waves of the survey, respondents are asked about their
\emph{ethnic nationality}.  Typically, individuals have a single ethnic
identity.  The answers are coded as ``Estonian'' or
``non--Estonian''.  As most of those who do not consider themselves
Estonian use Russian as their primary language, we refer to this group
as ``Russians''.

The labour market outcomes include ``last salary on the main job'' and
labour force status (working, unemployed or inactive).

The survey includes self-reported language skills on languages used at
home, and all other languages they understand.  The respondents are
give some guidance in assessing their skills, they can report either
no knowledge, understanding, speaking, writing, or using the
language at home.  We consolidate this information into a dummy, equal to zero
for languages one cannot speak (but potentially understand) and
unity if one speaks, speaks or writes, or uses that language at
home.

For further evidence on ethnic and gender segregation at workplace we use data
from 2008 Integration Monitor Survey.  The survey was conducted by
SaarPoll and focuses on
ethnic relations in Estonia.  The sample size is 1500,
500 of the respondents consider themselves not ethnic Estonians.  We analyse
two questions: ``which is the language of communication at your
workplace?'' and ``which languages do you need at work''.  The first
question addresses the ethnic segregation while the second focuses on
the need of communication.


\subsection{Descriptive Statistics}
\label{sec:descriptive}

The average wages, language skills and other explanatory variables together with the relative frequencies for the period 2000--2012 are presented in \cref{tab:descriptive}. We report the data separately for ethnic nationalities (Estonians and Russians) and language
skills (Estonian, Russian and English).

The table indicates that there are substantial disparities between
Estonians and Russians in wage and unemployment. For instance, the
average monthly salary\footnote{When interpreting the wage,
	one should keep in mind that during the period
	of observation, 2000-2012, the average salary increased by 180\%,
	from \EUR{314} to \EUR{887} monthly.

} of Estonian
males who are not fluent in English is \EUR{532} while for Russians it
is only \EUR{452}. However, we also see that Russians who speak
English earn approximately 40\% more than those who do not (\EUR{452}
versus \EUR{326} monthly for men and \EUR{307} versus \EUR{221} for
women). Estonian skills are associated with lower income premium, 15\%
for men (\EUR{378} versus \EUR{329} monthly) and 30\% for women
(\EUR{260} versus \EUR{203}).  Similarly, English is more closely
associated with income for Estonians than Russian language. In
contrast, unemployment shows a different picture. For ethnic Russians,
it is Estonian language fluency that is more closely associated with
low unemployment, those fluent in Estonian have 11.2 percent
unemployment rate while for those not fluent it is 17.3 percent.  The
corresponding numbers for English are 11.2 and 15.1.  For Estonians,
English is more closely associated with unemployment than Russian:
Estonians fluent in English have in average 5.0 percent unemployment
while those who are not fluent have 8.8 percent.  The difference
related to Russian fluency is only 1.6 percentage points.  However,
these associations are not easy to interpret as English skills are
also related to education, metropolitan residence, and general
ability.

The language fluency variables clearly show that ethnic identity is
closely related to language use: more than 99\% of Estonians report
being fluent in Estonian, the figure for Russians is similar. We
also see that Estonians are better in English than Russians and they
are also better in Russian than vice versa.

Average age reflects the trend of younger generations
being more fluent in English and Estonian while older Estonians being
better in Russian. The family variables follow the
respective age distribution. Not surprisingly, inter-ethnic
households include disproportionally large share of Russian speaking
Estonians and Estonian speaking Russians.
The average experience follows the same pattern as age.
Public sector jobs are associated with disproportionally large share of
Estonian fluency among Russian workers, probably reflecting the formal
language requirements and little room for ethnic segregation in that
sector.

In conclusion, the descriptive analysis suggests that for Russians,
English skills are a more important driver for income than Estonian
skills while the opposite is true for unemployment.  The labour market
outcomes of Estonians are substantially better correlated with English
skills than with Russian skills.



\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}

We analyse the relationship between labour market outcomes and language
skills by ordinary multivariate regression models.
Several related studies use instrumental variables to correct for
omitted variable bias and measurement errors \citep{Chiswick1995, bleakley+chin2004}.
%\ot{more examples here}
We refrain from doing that. Our decision is mainly data driven,
there are no suitable instruments in our data,\footnote{We run an IV
	regression using age--at--immigration to instrument Estonian skills
	for those Russians who were in the country at 1990.  The results are
	not statistically significant at any conventional level.} but it also facilitates
comparison with other studies.For instance,
\citet{azam+2013EDandCC} and \citet{paolo+tansel2015JofDevStud} only report OLS results.



There is also evidence from job language requirements suggesting that
the reduced-form evidence is not too different from the causal effect
\citep{beblavy+2016CEPS}.

\citet{azam+2013EDandCC} and \citet{paolo+tansel2015JofDevStud}, who use proxy variables to control for
individual ability, find these having little influence on the effect
of language skills.

We estimate unemployment probability by linear probability model
(LPM) to avoid unnecessary parametric
assumptions in the corresponding binary choice models.\footnote{The
	results of corresponding probit models are virtually equal to the LPM results.}
Similarly, we estimate the effect of language skills on wage by
OLS. We correct the estimates for the panel data structure by
clustering the standard errors by individuals.

%\fxnote{Add here another index g to denote the group? I used it in other articles, because it was requested and it makes sense}
We estimate the basic model in the following form:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:specification}
	\begin{split}
		y_{it} ^{g} = &\: 
		\\alpha_{g}{}' X_{it}^{g}+
		\\& + \vec{beta}^{g}{}' \cdot \vec{L}_{it}^{g} +
		\eta_{i}^{g} +
		\upsilon_t^{g} + \epsilon_{it}^{g},
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $y_{it}^{g}$ is the outcome (either unemployment indicator
or logarithm of net monthly wage)
of individual $i$ in wave $t$ from ethnic group g; $\vec{X}^{g}$ are the other individual
characteristics for both groups; $L$ is the vector of
language skill descriptors, $eta_{i}^{g}$ is the individual-specific effect, $\upsilon_{t}^{g}$ are the year dummies and $\epsilon_{it}^{g}$
is the idiosyncratic error term. We denote the groups g by E (Estonian) and R (Russian).
As we use panel data, we cluster the
standard errors on individuals.  When analysing the time trend, we
replace the main language effects in~\eqref{eq:specification} by the
\fxnote*{Did we estimate it really that way? At least not in my code.}{corresponding interactions}
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:time_interaction}
	\beta_{RUS,t} \cdot RUS_{it} \cdot \upsilon_{t} +
	\beta_{EST,t} \cdot EST_{it} \cdot \upsilon_{t} +
	\beta_{ENG,t} \cdot ENG_{it} \cdot \upsilon_{t}.
\end{align}


We estimate three models that differ in terms of the number of
control variables. The first one only includes the language skills
and year dummies. The second one also includes individual
characteristics, such as age, education, and county of residence.
Finally, the third model also includes industry, occupation, and other
workplace descriptors.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}
\subsection{Unemployment}
\label{subsec:basic_model_unemployment}

The central results for unemployment regressions are given in
\cref{tab:unemployment_estimation_by_sex_and_ethnic}.

The
table clearly indicates that Estonian language skills are associated
with approximately 5 percentage points lower unemployment for both
Russian men and women. We also see that the effect is not radically
influenced by the individual characteristics--for men it is
virtually unchanged while for women the estimate falls by 30\%.

Neither Russian nor English show a comparably strong effect.
Knowledge of Russian is not associated with less unemployment for
Estonian men, and is even related to a slightly higher unemployment
for Estonian women. The latter outcome may be related to omitted
variable bias, Russian knowledge was widespread before 1990 and may
not have been closely associated with any favourable characteristics,
but during the period was increasingly more associated with age.
English skills are related to less unemployment both for Estonian men
and women, but the effect is small.
For Russians, however, Estonian language skills matter. Those who are
fluent in that language have approximately 5 percentage point less
unemployment, the effect changes only a little when controlling for
individual characteristics.  In contrast, the effect of English
fluency is close to zero and not statistically significant.  As in
case of Estonian, individual characteristics change the estimates only
a little.

In summary, these results suggest that the Estonian language is
important for employment prospects. The role of English is
small, and that of Russian is almost non-existent despite a largely
bilingual service sector in the country.

\subsection{Wage Regressions}
\label{subsec:basic_model_wage}

\cref{tab:wage_estimation_by_sex_and_ethnic} presents the main
results.

The table
confirms that wage is positively associated with fluency in other
languages, in particular English. The only remarkable exception is
Estonian language for Russian men where we fail to find any positive
effect for any model. This qualitatively repeats the results of
\citet{Toomet2011}. However, for women we observe a sizeable
positive effect between 12 and 16 percentage points, suggesting that
\citet{Toomet2011} results only describe the male labour market.  The effect decreases somewhat
(from 0.167 to 0.114) when including the individual characteristics
into the model, suggesting that the premium
is partly caused by education and potentially also by unobserved
individual performance. Observable workplace characteristics do not
influence the estimates.

We also see that knowledge of Russian language is associated with a
substantial income premium of 10\% for both Estonian men and women.
The effect approximately halves when introducing
individual controls, suggesting that it is partly related to
education and potentially also to ability. It
falls further when also controlling for the
workplace characteristics, indicating that Estonians' income is
better characterized by available workplace
variables.

English language is associated with a very large
wage premium, up to 34 log points (model 1 for
Estonian men). It falls substantially when introducing the
individual characteristics into the model (model 2), additional
workplace characteristics have little effect.  However, in all
specifications it is
significantly more
important than Russian for Estonians. The estimates are rather
similar for Estonian and Russian men but little lower for Russian
women than for Estonian women.

In conclusion, the wage regressions suggest that English is the main
language that matters for men.  The effect of Russian is minor and
that of Estonian non-existent.  For women, all three languages are
associated with higher wage but Russian to a smaller extent.
This is in a stark contrast to the unemployment regressions, we return to
this question in the discussion.


\section{Extensions}
\label{sec:extensions}

\subsection{A Long-Run View}
\label{sec:long-run}

Here we look at the yearly estimates from 1992 to 2012.
We report those for the model 2.\footnote{The results for other models
	look essentially the same. If we add more variables like in model 3 then the effect size reduces by about five to ten percentage points, but the overall picture remains the same.}


The effect on language fluency on unemployment is shown on Figure~\ref{fig:long-run_unemployment} and on wage on Figure~\ref{fig:long-run_wage}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

	}
	\caption{The effect of language fluency on unemployment, 1992--2012}
	\label{fig:long-run_unemployment}
\end{figure}

The results reveal a few interesting facts.  First, the effects are
relatively stable over time, indicating that neither economic
environment nor the data quality have changed rapidly.  Estonian
fluency has been associated with less unemployment for both men and
women since around year 2000, in 1990s it had little effect.  Russian fluency,
in contrast, had never an impact on unemployment probability.


For Estonian men, fluency in English is associated with less unemployment through the whole
period of observation whereas fluency in Russian has no effect.
Only few of the results are statistically significant pointwise though.
For Estonian women, both languages are associated with less
unemployment in the 1990s but not later. The picture is different for
Russians. For men, we cannot see any substantial effect of fluency in English
whereas fluency in Estonian is clearly associated with less unemployment from
the late 1990s on. For women, the picture is mostly similar, just the
effect of Estonian language seems to be somewhat delayed compared to
that for men.

\end{figure}

The estimates for wage are rather stable as well. For Estonians, we
see a slight downward trend of the effect of fluency in Russian whereas
that of English becomes important in the late 1990s. For Russians, the
importance of English seems to be sliding across the years, probably
due to the increasing supply of these skills. For men, fluency in Estonian
has never been significantly associated with wage.
The results are remarkably stable over the whole period, stressing
the continuity of the peculiar labour market institutions,
potentially workplace segregation, through the
whole post-communist period. For women, however, we can see
a slight increasing trend, suggesting that there is either less
workplace segregation or other need for the official language for
the jobs commonly taken by women.


\subsection{Does the Effect Differ by Age?}
\label{sec:age_groups}

We also estimate the effects separately by age groups and time in
order to detect potential trends across the age groups and across ethnic groups
(Table~\ref{tab:age_group_trend_russian} and Table~\ref{tab:age_group_trend_estonian}).
We look separately at 4 sub-periods: Early transition period
(1989--1995); First economic growth period (1996--1999);
Economic boom, EU accession (2000--2007); and the recession
(2008--2012).

We use largely the same setup as described in section \ref{sec:method}. The results presented here are derived using the second model.


For ethnic Estonians, knowledge of Russian
(Table~\ref{tab:age_group_trend_estonian}) has become less
important after its peak in the late 1990s. Notably, the
association between wage and language skills are small in the
youngest age groups where the Russian skills are rapidly declining
while it still is strongly related to salary for
older workers. The importance of English language skills fluctuates
and slowly decline through the period, but the men from group (45-55) and young women (25-35) have a growing trend. They gain more from being fluent in English.

The positive impact of Estonian language skills for ethnic Russians
(Table~\ref{tab:age_group_trend_russian}) on earnings seems to
increase over the sample period for women in the young group (25--35)
and the prime age group (36--45).
While no statistically significant
correlation is visible for Russian men, good
Estonian is associated with about 10\% higher salary for Russian women for the boom in the 2000s. For the
recession period, the figure is even close to 12\%. These age
groups are the workers who were in their twenties or younger during
the major political and economic transition in early 1990s. It
suggests that the previously segregated ``Estonian'' and ``Russian''
economy are slowly becoming a more integrated one where ethnic
Russians with a good Estonian command can get well-paid jobs.
In comparison, the estimates for English language fluency shows downward trend for all age groups for men and for women. This is due to the language skills becoming more common among the population.

We estimate the effect of language skills for unemployment as well for the second model. However too little results are statistically significant. The importance of Estonian language skills was growing during the latest periods and is associated with approximately 7 percentage points lower unemployment for both Russian men and women. The best results are reached for the youngest age groups and for middle age groups.
English skills are related to less unemployment both for Russian men and women. The effect is smaller for Estonian men while for Estonian women all results are insignificant.

\section{Additional Evidence: Estonian Language at Workplace}
\label{sec:segregation_analysis}

Previous results can be explained by two hypotheses: first, Russian--speaking men are working
primarily in Russian language environment while this is not true for
women; and second, Russian-speaking men are working in jobs with
little communication requirements (gender segregation).

To shed some additional light on these hypotheses, we use data
from 2008 Integration Monitor Survey.  We focus on
two questions: ``which is the language of communication at your
workplace?'' and ``which languages do you need at work''.  The first
question addresses the ethnic segregation while the second focuses on
the need of communication.  As very few individuals work in English
environment, we only look for Estonian as the communication language.

\begin{table}[t]

	\begin{tabular}{lrr}

\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:environment_descriptive} shows the proportion of
Russian respondents who use Estonian as the main communication language at work, and
who need Estonian and English at work.  As we see, women are more likely to
use Estonian than men while the opposite is true for English.
Table~\ref{tab:environment_model} presents the regression results when
controlling for other
characteristics, including education and geographic location.

\end{table}

The table indicates that Russian women need Estonian 26 percentage
points more at work than Russian men.  The table also suggests that
Russian women are 16 percentage points more likely to be working in
Estonian-speaking environment when controlling for other factors.
Both estimates are statistically significant (at 5\% and 10 \% level
respectively), but not precisely estimated.  We can also see that
college education is associated by much more Estonian need and usage,
but in regions where Russian speakers are concentrated, the capital
Tallinn and the North-East, Estonian is less needed.  In contrast, no
gender difference is visible for English needs.

In summary, this dataset supports the previous hypothesis: Russian women are
working in less segregated environment where Estonian is the main
communication language, and they need Estonian for other reasons as
well.  Gender differences in English usage are not statistically
significant.

Additionally we briefly analysed online job market \href{http://www.cv.ee/english/}{cv.ee}.  We measured all jobs
that required English, Finnish and Russian, and calculated the average education requirement
at these jobs (coded as college/less than college education).  According to the observations,
the jobs that required English, in average, 51\% of college education while those where Finnish is requested, 19\% and Russian is 26\% respectively.

\section{Discussion and Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:discussion}

We document that different languages are associated in a
different way with unemployment and wage. Our most
intriguing observation is that
Russian men earn virtually no income premium from being fluent in Estonian,
the majority and official language of the country, while the fluency is related to a substantially
lower unemployment rate.
Our analysis supports \citet{YaoandOurs2015} and \citet{Lindemann2013} finding that
the labour market is segmented between ethnic and gender lines.
However, we find that ethnic segregation is less prevalent at the lower end
of the male labour market.
The lower--end labour market, associated with frequent unemployment, is
better integrated and
those who are fluent in the language may expect both less unemployment
and higher wage.  However, men at better paid and more stable jobs
gain little from Estonian.  We
suppose this is because the middle and upper-end labour market is more
segregated and even
those who speak the official language cannot improve their income
much.  This is possibly a type of glass-ceiling effect.  This hypothesis is
supported by \citet{leppik+vihalemm2015JofBaltStud} who show that
Estonian language skills are not associated with improved career
mobility over time.  It is also corroborated with the quantile regression evidence that
Estonian language is related to a positive wage premium only at the
lowest end of income scale \citep{Toomet2011}.  There is also
anecdotal evidence suggesting that offices are
typically manned by ethnic Estonians while production units have a
large share of Russian workers.
One can speculate that this outcome is related to a substantial population share
with negative attitudes toward Russians \citep{korts2009JofBaltStud}.

The ethnic segregation seems to be less of an issue for women.
Unfortunately, neither \citet{Toomet2011} nor
\citet{leppik+vihalemm2015JofBaltStud} analyse men and women
separately.  We suppose that women are more frequently employed in jobs in which they need Estonian
language more, such as working in a direct contact with customers.
We also find evidence that over time Estonian is becoming more
important in the female labour market.  Unfortunately, the current data
does not let us to assess whether is due to decreasing segregation, or
economy--wide rise of Estonian language.  No such trend is visible for men.

The other results are more in line with other studies.
English language is related to a substantial income premium but
virtually to no effect on unemployment.  This is similar to findings by
\citet{ginsburgh+prieto-rodriguez2011ILRR} and
\citet{beblavy+2016CEPS} who show that English is more important at better paid
jobs.  In contrast, our outcomes suggest that English has little use
at low-paid, unstable jobs \citep{Toomet2011}.

Note also that for
English, we are able to explain a substantial part of the raw effect
by individual characteristics, suggesting that the true causal effect
may be smaller than our estimates.

The study has a number of limitations.  Although we believe that our
estimates are good indicators of a causal relationship, we cannot make
such claim unless a suitable instruments for language skills can be
found.  In particular, as individual characteristics are able to explain a
large part of English returns, we suppose part of the remaining effect
may also related to an ability bias.  Another weak point in the current
data, although it is
standard in the literature, is using the self-reported language
skills.  As language test data becomes available, we may be able to
decrease the measurement error in the future.
